      <h3>Deconstruction Isn’t the Bad Guy—Here’s Why</h3>
      <p>When I first accepted Jesus into my heart, it didn’t work. Well, not like I thought it would.

        I was seven years old when I attended a power team event with my dad and brother. We watched in awe as these
        80s-looking, overly muscular, non-steroid (I think), tank top wearing weight lifters performed the most obscure
        tasks in the name of Jesus. Some of them ripped phone books with their bare hands. Others laid on a bed of nails
        as someone from their team took a sledge hammer to a block of ice that rested on their chest. I remember sitting
        on my dad’s shoulders thinking that these guys were the closest thing to real life superheroes. And then, they
        invited me to become one of them.

        With sweat running down his face, one of the team members took the mic and gave the most obscure, and
        manipulative, invitation to follow Jesus. Imagine the following dialogue in the voice of Hulk Hogan.

        “We only have this strength because our Lord and Savior gave it to us. If you would like to be strong like us, I
        want you to come to the front on the count of three.”

        Remember, I was seven. What seven year old doesn’t dream of having super-human strength? I climbed off my dad’s
        shoulders and eagerly awaited the count.

        “One!”

        I couldn’t believe it! My life was about to change. No more bullies at school. The girls would overlook my
        glasses and comb-over. I was going to have it all.

        “Two!”

        Was my brother going up? I needed bigger muscles than him. Maybe if I got to the front before him . . .

        “Three!”

        Like a horse at the Kentucky derby, I was off. I ran to the front, prayed the prayer of salvation, opened my
        eyes, and—nearly 30 years later—I have yet to experience the power that these Sons of Thunder promised. Not only
        did the muscles never come, but my body seems to grow in the wrong direction. I may have accepted Jesus into my
        heart, but he steered clear of my muscles. It’s safe to say I felt betrayed by belief that night.

        Sometimes, we accumulate beliefs that are, obviously, unhelpful or untrue. But what do we do when it’s not
        obvious? Moreover, what do we do when the beliefs that betray us are hurtful, harmful, or even cruel? When a
        person, or group of people, decide to attach their cognitive bias to a chapter and verse of the Bible,
        questioning that belief is seen as questioning the Bible. With the amount of traditions, denominations, and
        churches, it’s not a shocker that more and more people would be participating in this big, scary word:
        deconstruction. What I have found through interviews and research is this: If your faith doesn’t grow up with
        you, you will deconstruct intentionally or eventually. Meaning that either your questions about life will
        initiate deconstruction, or the difficulties of life will initiate it for you.

        Deconstruction is the picking apart of a belief, practice, or tradition to test it for its usefulness,
        truthfulness, and effectiveness. Inasmuch as we agree on this basic definition, deconstruction is not the bad
        guy. Here’s why:

        We all do it
        Perhaps you are reading this with one eyebrow raised and your head tilted to the side, perplexed by a pastor’s
        defense of deconstruction. Before you move on to a different article, consider that you might be deconstructing
        my view of deconstruction! It’s a spiritual muscle that everyone practices. Even you.

        All the time.

        Every day.

        We deconstruct those views we don’t agree with. We deconstruct those people we don’t understand. Our minds are
        always picking apart the news, social media feeds, or passive aggressive text messages, and we are testing these
        things to see if they are true, useful, or effective. To not deconstruct would mean we would have to blindly
        accept (as truth) every bias, preference, or opinion. That would be a world void of conviction, innovation, or
        absolute truth.

        I think many Christians’ reactions to the term is because it closely resembles two other words: destruction and
        deconversion. But both have entirely different meanings. We are not talking about blowing something up, nor are
        we talking about leaving it entirely. We are talking about getting to the foundation.

        Deconstruction is all about getting to the foundation.

        We have always deconstructed
        If you are a Protestant reading this, deconstruction is part of your spiritual heritage. It’s your spiritual
        migration. It’s how you got to the doctrines and practices that you center your life on. What was Martin Luther
        doing if not deconstructing in order to reconstruct a new authority? I dedicate a whole chapter to this in my
        book, starting with the Old Testament prophets all the way to present day. The central idea being that Jesus had
        to deconstruct if he was going to establish himself as the ultimate authority over religious tradition (Mark 7)
        and practice (Matthew 5:21-48). Following Jesus’ example, reformations (or effective deconstruction movements)
        have taken place when the predominant expression of Christianity of the day bears a faint resemblance to Jesus.

        Jesus, and Jesus followers, have never settled for a faith that doesn’t allow them to love and live like Jesus
        did. The question we must honestly ask ourselves is not whether we should be deconstructing. The question is:
        Does evangelical Christianity look like Jesus?

        I submit that it does not.

        This is where we must make an important distinction between being a Jesus follower and being an evangelical
        Christian. All evangelical Christians must look like Jesus, but not all Jesus followers must look like
        evangelical Christians. The two are not necessarily at odds with each other, but they are also not the same.
        That being said, if the current state of evangelical Christianity bears a faint resemblance to the
        Jesus-looking-God of the Bible, we have a spiritual, and moral, obligation to lead the way, once again, in
        deconstructing so that people can see God in the face of Christ more clearly.

        Deconstructing faith is the discipline of a Jesus follower, and we would be wise in reclaiming it once again.

        We can never stop
        There has never been, nor will there ever be, a time in history when the predominant religious expression of any
        given culture looks and acts like Jesus. We will always need to remind culture that they have heard it said, but
        Jesus says unto them. They have heard it said by pastors, parents, and profit seekers. But Jesus has a new word.

        I believe that those who are following Jesus in this way can oftentimes feel like a voice in the wilderness. An
        annoyance to the religious leaders and the religious norm. That has always been the case, and that can’t keep us
        from trying to heal the deep sadness caused by our label.

        We can’t rewind, but we can rebuild.

        We must rebuild.

        And to rebuild, we must first deconstruct.</p>

      <h3>A child of God</h3>
      <p>If I were to ask you what your relationship is with the Supreme Father (Param Pita),
        the Supreme Soul (Param Atma), what would you say? You’d likely respond with:
        “Well, He is the Supreme Father, so obviously, He is my Father, and I am His child.”
        Great! Next question: “Do you ever worry or experience fear or anxiety?”
        If the answer is yes then, it might be useful to re-examine my response to the first question.
        Why? Because I cannot be a child of God and be worried and anxious at the same time; they are mutually
        exclusive.

        A child is fearless, it doesn’t even know what worry, or anxiety is.
        When the child needs something,
        it simply runs to its father and there is no shred of doubt in its mind if the need will be fulfilled or not.
        As far as the child is concerned: it’s a done deal. This is unshakeable faith, a faith that gives me rest.
        Similarly, if the child makes a mistake, it doesn’t run away and hide, rather,
        it runs to the father as fast as it can because it has faith that the father will put it right.
        The child has no questions or doubts about anything, there is just implicit trust in the father.
        It simply takes the father’s hand and allows itself to be led. A child is therefore always light,
        and carefree, full of zeal and enthusiasm for life. This is why everyone loves being around little children.

        Things change though when the child grows up and becomes an adult.
        My world expands- I am now so-and-so, this is my title, my social status,
        my accomplishments.
        I have many different roles and relationships and I spend my life trying to juggle all of them the best I can.
        When a relationship changes or breaks, there is discomfort or heartache.
        When I am hustling for that promotion, there is anxiety as to whether
        I will get it or not. When there is a situation however big or small,


        I instantly worry: ‘What will happen now?’ or ‘How am I going to make it?”
        When life presents me with tough choices, I become paralyzed trying to decide if I should do this or that,
        if something is right or wrong. Life that was once so simple and carefree is now anything but.

        What changed during this transition from childhood to adulthood?
        My heart. Previously, my heart was whole with only my father seated on the throne.
        He was my whole world. ‘I’ was just the child and ‘mine’ was the one father and none other.
        That same heart is now broken into many pieces with each piece attached to a different person,
        an accomplishment, a title and all the rest. Let me check if this is the state of my relationship with my
        eternal Father.
        Am ‘I’ still just the child or am I a lot of things? Is ‘mine’ still just the one Father and none other or has
        that changed to mine is the one Father and many others?

        While it might sound counter-intuitive, the key to living a victorious,
        liberated life is to simply go back to being the child again.
        I continue to play various roles in my daily life- for example,
        I play the roles of a mother, a sister, a teammate, a swimmer,
        an engineer etc., but I don’t identify with them any longer.
        I see the roles as what I do, not as who I am.
        Who I am is a child of God. Where there is this surrender,
        the Father becomes responsible for my life.

        When situations come and they will, I no longer find myself alone,
        worried, and anxious. With childlike faith,
        I simply trust the Father to take my boat across and He does,
        every single time. When I need help with decisions,
        I take the Father’s advice. He is longing to be part of my life,
        every tiniest aspect of it, if I will allow Him.
        God never imposes His will on me, He waits for me to recognize Him
        for who He truly is, my Father, and relate to Him in that way,
        practically.

        And so, I ask again: What is my relationship with the Supreme Father,
        the Supreme Soul? If I can solve this riddle, I attain liberation in life.

        Wearable

        Wearable technology is taking the world by storm, with more and more companies and individuals embracing its
        potential to revolutionize the way we manage our health and well-being. From tracking our diets to monitoring
        our fitness levels, wearable devices are making it easier than ever to stay on top of our health. It’s no

      <h3>Learn a New Skill on this World Youth Skills Day</h3>
      <p>Every year, on the 15th of July, World Youth Skills Day is celebrated to inspire young individuals to explore
        vocational and technical education and training. This global observance highlights the importance of skill
        development in empowering the youth to become skilled professionals, fostering personal growth, and adapting to
        various life situations. While acquiring diverse vocational and technical skills is crucial, it is equally
        important to recognize the skill of being a first responder in the mental health sector.

        What do we mean by a “First Responder”?

        In emergency medical situations, first responders are pivotal in providing immediate assistance to those in
        need. From administering CPR and controlling bleeding to stabilizing patients and coordinating with medical
        teams, first responders form the critical link between an individual’s medical emergency and professional
        medical care. Their swift actions can make a crucial difference in saving lives and mitigating the severity of
        injuries.

        Now let’s talk about the importance of First Responders in the field of mental health. While the role of first
        responders in the medical field is widely acknowledged, it is equally important to recognize the significance of
        first responders in mental health. Mental health emergencies are rising, and individuals experiencing crises
        require immediate support and intervention.

        Imagine a scenario where your friend is talking to you about their recent job loss. They are starting to get
        visibly upset, and they start to cry. You try to comfort them, but they seem to get increasingly upset. They
        start to hyperventilate, and they tell you that they feel like they are going to pass out. You are unsure what
        to do as you have never seen your friend like this before, and you feel helpless. You don’t want to say or do
        the wrong thing, so you sit there cluelessly and watch them struggle but feel guilty that you didn’t know how to
        help them.

        First responders in the mental health sector can provide vital assistance during these critical moments. They
        possess the skills and knowledge to assess, de-escalate, and provide initial aid to individuals facing mental
        health crises, including suicidal ideation, panic attacks, or severe emotional distress.

        The demand for mental health first responders has become more pronounced in recent times due to the growing
        awareness of mental health issues and the need for accessible and immediate support. Mental health first
        responders receive specialized training to address crises empathetically and effectively. They possess the
        ability to communicate compassionately, actively listen, and offer appropriate resources and referrals to
        individuals in distress. Their presence and timely response can help prevent the escalation of mental health
        crises, offer support, and guide individuals toward the appropriate mental health resources and treatments they
        may require.

        As we commemorate World Youth Skills Day, let us not only emphasize the significance of vocational and technical
        education but also recognize the importance of being a first responder in both the medical and mental health
        sectors. Acquiring skills in these domains empowers the youth to be at the forefront of emergency response,
        saving lives and providing crucial support during challenging times. By nurturing a new generation of first
        responders, we can create a better-equipped society to address medical and mental health crises, promoting
        overall well-being and resilience for individuals and communities alike.</p>

      <h3>Communication is important</h3>
      <p>Silence is a way of communicating your ideas at times. Sometimes it becomes really necessary to talk and
        express the feelings without just remaining silent. Things differ a lot from person to person and so does the
        dilemma of handling a particular situation at the home front. So, it is really necessary to talk and subside the
        fear of being missed out on occasions. When a child starts talking it is really helpful to understand and is
        effective in their way because they can now speak and express themselves which was till date barred because of
        their growing terms and milestones. Parents can understand them more clearly and can definitely provide them
        with better ways to coax them for a healthy environment at home. Talking is not just important for the toddlers
        or little ones but at times we as adults do also make mistake of not sharing things which can help us to
        unburden ourselves form lot of disparities.

        Also, at our workplace or at the area where we are conducting ourselves for a duty or job, being communicative
        enough is the foremost batch of indulgence we should make up to. We just cannot wait for things to come to our
        bay and then initiate our performances. Things need to be given required attention and detailing to follow up on
        many aspects. Talking and sharing ideas is one of the tree structures to make the branches out for a fresh gash
        of air to make things easy and carefree for all. You need to talk and project wat you are feeling about the job,
        workers along with you and how far you are ok with the environment you are supposed to work on. Things do change
        and one should come up with different timings however, it is also important not to hide the very essence of your
        emotions anyway.

        Communication is not always verbal but can be communicated in other ways too. Try to understand the lines thrown
        at you or make you the best version of yourself. Reading in-between the lines is again very important when you
        are fixed in a situation which only you can help yourself. Let’s try to see beyond the veil which is seeking us
        to stay deep within ourselves and not get involved in something else to free ourselves on being communicative
        and progressive in thoughts too.
